# Conversation Flow - Basics

Voice conversations are supported by combining language elements for receiving user input, along with elements for output as well as conversational elements (which track user state). Custom elements (widgets) can also be created and used as needed.

Each element can be given an `id` for accessing later to either extend the conversational model or to allow the flow to jump to the point.
